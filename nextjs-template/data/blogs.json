Additionally, it flags role-based emails, such as generic addresses for businesses, which may not belong to a specific individual and could impact engagement rates."

        "content": "Email bounce rate refers to the percentage of emails that fail to be delivered to recipients. A high bounce rate means fewer people are receiving your content, which lowers the chances of interaction, conversion, and ultimately, revenue. These bounces are often categorized into two types: hard and soft. Hard bounces result from invalid or non-existent email addresses. Soft bounces occur due to temporary delivery issues such as full inboxes or server errors."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "While soft bounces can sometimes be resolved automatically, hard bounces damage your sender reputation. Over time, repeated bounces can land your emails in spam folders or even lead to blacklisting. For marketers, this creates a cycle where the cost of campaigns stays the same, but returns diminish significantly."
